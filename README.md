Testimonials grid section solution


My process
I started by reviewing the design specification. I then started markup knowing that the mobile and desktop layouts would use the same cards, with different page layouts. From there, I stated the styling with mobile-first workflow and then created two media queries to handle the transition from the mobile to the desktop layouts.

Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
Mobile-first workflow
CSS custom properties
CSS Grid
Flexbox

What I learned
This project was an excellent excercise in CSS grid and I learned how CSS grid made the layout of the individual card and the page significantly easier than traditional CSS. I learned how to use minmax, auto, and 1fr to make the page flow from mobile-first to the desktop.
